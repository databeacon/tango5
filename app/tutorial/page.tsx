                        question="What is the first tool of the Tango5 suite?"
                        answer="The first Tango5 tool focuses on sharpening your eye to identify all potential conflicts before the time runs out, simulating the experience of an en-route radar Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) when identifying potential conflicts."

                        question="How does Tango5 define a potential conflict?"
                        answer="Your job in the first tool of Tango5 is to detect every time a crossing is within 9NM (Nautical Miles), which are potential conflicts that need to be monitored. The minimum acceptable separation is 5NM in most regions, such as the ones we are displaying."

                        question="Why is traffic in Tango5 not moving?"
                        answer="Because of the increasing complexity. We wanted  the first tool of Tango5 to be as accessible as possible but still giving value and a challenge to experienced ATCOs. We will include this feature in future releases, stay tuned!"

                        question="If the legal separation is 5NM, why do controllers need to monitor below 9NM?"
                        answer="When two aircraft get slightly above 5NM at the crossing (5-9NM), controllers need to specially monitor the pair, so that they donâ€™t miss the legal separation due to changes of wind, speed, etc."
